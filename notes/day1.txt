BeagleBone black
	* embedded systems arti.
		applications
		middleware(user defined API)(.c & .h files)
		Os+drivers(.c &.h files)
		Hardware
	* os is complusary for time based programs
	* USer defined Drivers & kernals drivers
	* Os is linux debian or arnstrom
	* texa series of AM335 in SOC
	*  AM335x 1GHz ARMÂ® Cortex-A8

SOC(Systems on chips)
	* part number is U5
	* XAM3359A
	
Embedded MMC (eMMC)
	part No: is U13.
	
DDR3 
	part no : is U12

UART 
	part no: J1

Boot loader 
	part no : s2

Power Button 
	part no: is s3 

Mini port (power BBB(BealgeBone Black)):
	part no: P6
	
Memory card slot:
	part No: P10
	
MMC0 is connected to microSD card.
MMC1 is Connected to eMMC .
	
DC Adapter:
	1A current and 5V voltage.
	
* more tha 2A of current can damage the board (short circuits)
 8N1 no parity and one stop bit in bandrate	
 
 
 Booting Process have 3 Steps :
 	1.RBL(ROM BootLoader) stage
 	2.SPL/MLO(Secondary program Loader/ memory Loader) stage
 	3.U-Boot stage--To load and Run the linux kernel
 	
 *then handed over to kernel
 not define by address --spl
 defined by address -- mlo
 
 * Booting Options
 
 RBL
 	* b/w Soc and SPL/MLO there is MMC Interface
 	* effect to ROM of SOC as RBL is stored in ROM of SOC
 	* Stack setup
 	* system clock configuration using pll
 	* search memory devices or other bootable interface for mlo or spl
 	* copy spl or mlo in SRAM
 	* watchdog timer is setup for 3 mins
 * 11100b--SYSBOOT[4:0]--MMC1-MMC0-UART0-USB0

 installation commands
 
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get upgrade
 sudo apt-get install gparted
 
 *  There are 46 pins at one side each
  difference to raspiberry is there is an analog pins(7 pins) that only reads 0 to 1.8V only not 3.3V and 5V
  
 *  we need to make two partitions
 >>dmesg
   SD card-sdb
 * open gparted software select the sd card sdb
 * delete or unmount any previous images if present
 * go to unallocated and click on new 
 * got to file system select fat16 -automatically 4 gb is selected( 2gb is enough)
 * In label area in CAPS write BOOT-> click on add
 * to make RFS select in file system-> ext3
 * In label area in CAPS write ROOTFS-> click on add
 * To format - click on check box on top -> apply
